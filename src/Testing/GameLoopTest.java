    a.  One point card from the top of any of the draw piles, or 
    b.  Two veggie cards from those available in the veggie market.

around).

12. Continue step 7-12 for the next player until there are no more cards in the Point 
Salad Market 

13. Calculate the score for each player according to the point cards in hand.
